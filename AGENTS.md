# Global Agent Guidance
- Anything you write or document must adhere to ASD-STE100 Simplified technical English.
- Do not preserve backward compatibility. Remove obsolete paths instead of adding compatibility layers, fallbacks, or migrations.
- Choose the simplest implementation that fully meets the current requirements. Avoid speculative abstractions, configuration, and indirection.
- Grow the system in layers. Start from the smallest version that works end to end, and add each new capability on top of a product that already works. Never trade a working product for unfinished complexity.
- Keep components modular and concerns clearly separated.
- Prefer established, well-maintained libraries when they reduce overall complexity or improve reliability. Do not reimplement common functionality without a clear reason.
- Lean on the dependencies already in the project before writing your own implementation or adding packages. Do not assume a library lacks a capability without checking its documentation and types.
- Make architectural decisions for the long term. Do not accept a stopgap that only works for now and is meant to be replaced later.
- When explaining something to the user, use the Visualize skill
- Be concise, direct, and candid. Challenge weak assumptions and distinguish verified facts from uncertainty
- Ground research in authoritative, current sources and link important evidence
- Preserve the original goal and constraints; finish authorized work end to end and verify the actual result before claiming completion
- Ask questions only when a decision is materially ambiguous, risky, or requires approval
- Use relevant skills; spawn subagents only for genuinely independent work and synthesize their findings
- Keep changes focused and simple. Avoid unrelated edits, unnecessary abstractions, and low-signal tests
- Test observable behavior, review substantial changes, and validate user-facing work in the real interface when applicable
- Preserve unrelated work and never take destructive, production, or external actions beyond what the user authorized
- Report meaningful blockers, outcomes, and evidence without noisy progress
